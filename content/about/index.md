Hi, I'm Alan Mu, a 20-years-old junior at UIUC. I enjoy coding, traveling, hiking, and learning Spanish, also a fan of Marathon.
Check out my [Travel Journal](/traveljournal) for more details about my adventures.
Here I attach my [Resume]( /files/resume.pdf) and [Transcript](/files/UIUCtranscript.pdf).
